h2. Usage

h3. First Clone the Repository

<pre>
user:~$ git clone https://github.com/b-stone/GraphsRings-2014.git
user:~$ cd GraphsRings-2014
</pre>

h3. Download MathJax

The slides need MathJax to translate the LaTeX to html.  The easiest way to get it is to clone the repo.

<pre>
user:~/GraphsRings-2014$ git clone https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax.git
</pre>

This creates a directory 'MathJax' in the 'GraphsRings-2014' folder. Depending on your OS, you might have to change the folder name to 'mathjax'. 

h3. View

You can start up a local webserver by using python's simple server:

<pre>
user:~/GraphsRings-2014$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000
</pre>

Now go to "http://0.0.0.0:3000":http://0.0.0.0:3000/ in your browser to view the slides.
